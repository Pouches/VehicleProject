            <p>The M4 Sherman tank was the backbone of the U.S. Armored Forces from early 1940 to late 1947. It was known for its realiability and good crew survivbility. When if first rolled onto the battlefield it had one of the best guns for its time with great High Explosive shells. It also had a simple hatch design that contributed to the survivbility, push up and climb out, with later models having spring assisted hatches. Later models also improved the suspension, engine, gun and armor. The most well armored version was a modified <span class="modelVersion">Easy 8</span>, called the <span class="modelVersion">Thunderbolt VII</span>. The M4 sherman has seen all corners of the world and has proven to be a realiable tank, for the time, and a good tank. It was last retired from service in 2018 by paraguay, marking the end of the service life for this legendary vehicle.
